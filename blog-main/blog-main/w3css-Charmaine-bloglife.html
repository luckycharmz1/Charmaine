            <p>Five years ago, God put it on my heart to go the mission field. Unfortunately, I said no! Gasp! I know right. Saying no to God! Yet, He kept tugging on my heart about it every moment for a week until I finally said yes. This was during my freshman year at Bible College. After I had finally said yes, there was a chapel message that afternoon about how God calls us somewhere just to see if we are willing to go. I thought, yep, that’s what He is doing to me. So, I gave up on the idea of going to the mission field. That summer I went home, and God began to start tugging on my heart again about missions. I was confused, I didn’t know what He was doing. That summer I had a friend who was Hispanic, her name is Anna Gaona, I don’t know if you remember her from reading an earlier blog post she did on my blog page. Anyways, I would go over to her house almost every day, and I was like a part of the family. I begin to pick up on more Spanish words as well as grow to love the Hispanic people more. Summer came to an end, and I ended up going back to Bible College. I had new roommates that year and I was excited. We all ended up being very close to each other. There were four of us, and out of the four of us. Two of us lived closed to each other. It was a small world after all. They were the first to hear of my calling to missions.
              So, when it came time for me to take off some time from college because of finance reasons; my roommate asked if I wanted to drive down with her to Texas. She said that she would look out for me. She just so happened to be Hispanic, and I would join her at her church. Her church had both English and Spanish church. In which I was a part of both, but I loved the Spanish church more. So, that is where I would spend most of my time. I learned a lot of Spanish songs on the Spanish bus route. I would sit in the Spanish services every morning. I even got the chance to sing a song in Spanish church. I just loved it so much. One day, I told my friend that I thought that God was still calling me to missions. She replied, “Where do you think he’s calling you?” I said, “I don’t know, but I think it’s a Spanish country.” That night we had started our missions conference, and I remember going to church early to help out with some things. I remember that there was this older gentlemen who had approached me. Out of respect, I spoke to him in Spanish. He said, ”Wow! Are you one of the missionaries?” I said no. He then replied with this, ”Well you should become one. Your Spanish is really good!”</p>
            <p>I didn’t confide in anyone else other than my old roommate about what God was doing in my heart. And I was just so amazed to see how God was using what that man said to confirm what He was doing in my heart. Sadly though, I still had my doubts. I ended up going back to bible college. I changed my major from music to general, because I didn’t know what the future had for me. I worked very hard in every aspect of my college life, and God was doing the same in my heart for missions. Before college had started that year, I was a bridesmaid in a wedding of an old friend of mine. I met her soon to be in laws at the wedding. They were very nice people. I found out that they were starting an orphanage, and they could really use the help. I asked where. It just so happened to be in Mexico. So, during my years at college, I kept praying about the mission field. Until one day, God pressed it on my eart so badly that I wanted to drop out of bible college and just go right then and there! I called my friends mother in law and told her what was happening. She told me that I shouldn’t drop out of Bible College because she didn’t want me to regret it later on in life. So, almost everyday I prayed for that orphanage that I wanted to go help in Mexico. I worked really hard to make sure I would graduate and go be a blessing to a bunch of orphans.

            <p>I remember the day that God called me to go to Bible College like it was yesterday. I was at a secular college with the intention of becoming an architect, and I thought how could I possibly go through four years of Bible College. You see, I was getting financial aid at this secular college that I was attending. I didn’t have to pay a dime out of my pocket. I knew that going to Bible College meant that I had to find a way to pay for my tuition on my own. The burden that God had placed on my heart to go to Bible College was heavy, and so I just surrendered by faith. To my luck though, my church at the time helped paid for me to go. It was a little hard my first semester to get accustomed to being at bible college. I was only saved for a year, and I didn’t know much. I thought I was definitely going to get kicked out, there were a lot of new rules that I had to adhere by. My second semester was harder than my first. I was struggling financially. So, I went to get advice from Bro. Nikoley. He told me that people like me shouldn’t be at bible college due to my health. He said that I should take off one, maybe two, semesters. Save up as much as I can, and try to come back with a car. That is exactly what I did. I took off a year, went to live with my family in Texas, and came back with a car and a little extra money saved up. To say that it was an easy break is a lie. My parents weren’t supportive of me being at Bible College. They wanted me to drop out. My dad even went as far as to say that I was weak, a failure, and will never be anything more. Apparently, he only wanted me to pursue a job that would make me a lot of money. To me it was never about the money. I just wanted to serve God. After my dad said all of that to me, I went to spend the week with my friend, Melanie, to help clear my head and determine what I was going to do next. When I came back home, all of my stuff was thrown in a closet. I took that as if they didn’t want me to be there anymore. Besides, my dad would always come home from work and yell throughout the house that he didn’t want me and my siblings to live there anymore. Breaking glass, slamming doors, and punching a hole in the wall to make his point clear. So, I packed up what I could in my car and left. Jumping from couch to couch. Sometimes, I didn’t have a couch to sleep on. Those were dark moments in my life. One of my friends found out, took me in for a while, and encouraged me to go back to college. Which is what I did. Although I did what Bro. Nikoley told me to. I was still struggling with finances. This time though my doctor told me I shouldn’t be in college. It was really starting to affect my health, but that burden was still there. I wanted God to do something with me, even though I felt like I was nothing. No matter how much I prayed for that, I still felt like a failure, and there came a time when I couldn’t pay my college bill. Certain staff members were telling me to go home. That I was wasting my time and money. I didn’t listen though.</p>
            <p>A ship doesn’t sink because of the water that is around it. It sinks becuase of the water that is in it. It’s so easy to get caught up in the approval and opinions of others, but don’t let the water get in your boat.
              After all that happened, things started to get a little better after that. I was working two jobs, so that I could pay for bible college.
              It came to my last year of bible college and I was going to graduate. If I wasn’t working, I was in classes, and if I wasn’t in classes, I was studying to make sure that I would graduate. Though I did all of this, I still failed a class and couldn’t graduate. I was soo upset and wanted to give up. My friend Hannah Murphy told me to get back up and try again and to try harder than before. So, I did just that. Your friendships will impact your future. If it wasn’t for Hannah Murphy, I wouldn’t have finished.
              I got back up and tried a little harder. Then my doctor told me my last semester that there is a possibility that I may lose my liver. That he needed to take certain precautions to avoid that. So, now because of that, I am in more pain, I’m more tired, and I’m a little weaker than I was before. By this time I learned that the more valuable the prize to be won, the greater the difficulty and cost. So, I pushed on and now I can say that I finished bible college.
              Second to my salvation, graduating is my biggest accomplishment, and I couldn’t have done it without God. Those four years were trying times. I didn’t have much. No health. No finances. No home. I spent holidays and birthdays alone. If all I have though is God, then all I have is all I need (John 14:8).
              Though my flesh and my heart faileth, God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p>

            <p>I often hear people say that hate is a strong word. Well, I believe so is love. Hate is intense and it expresses that you have a passionately negative feeling towards something or someone. To say that you love someone is equally the same. You have a passionately positive feeling. So many people throw the “L” word around like its nothing. Even if you aren’t a Christian, that word ought to mean something when you use it. And if you are a Christian, then it just mean so much more. The Bible commands us to love one another. Do you sincerely love others? Do you know what is love?
              I believe loving others starts with us. In Galatians 5:14, the Bible tells us to love thy neighbor as you love thyself. Now you may ask yourself this, how does loving others start with myself? Well if you don’t love yourself, then how can you possibly love others.
              Do you love yourself? I mean when you look in the mirror everyday, do you love the person that is staring back? I can tell you that many people don’t, because I was one of them. When we don’t love ourselves and we’re not careful, we will look at others and envy them. Because they have something that you don’t have. Whether it is the good looks, success, skills or qualities we desire to have. And that my friend is not love, because charity envieth not (1 Corinthians 13:4). Learn to love yourself, so that you can love others. To say that you don’t love yourself is saying that you don’t trust the one who made you. God created us in His image, and He loved us so much that He sent His only Son to die for you and I ( Romans 5:8). God loved you first and just the way you are.
              Maybe you do love yourself and others, but what about your enemies? If you have love, then you shouldn’t have ill will towards anyone not even your enemies. We need to start defining our love the way He defines it. When we truly love someone, we will overlook their faults. No matter how much they hurt you. I’m preaching to myself as well. I think about my mother and how she left me at a young age. I’ve always asked myself, how can I love someone who has never been there for me? We need to be willing to forgive, inclining to be merciful towards them that have hurt us. Love people who can’t love you back. Jesus did! When we were sinners, lost in the world, and rejecting Him, He still loved us. Learn to love people where they are at, and not where you want them to be.
              Once you have learned to love, go find someone who has no one and show them love. Even if they don’t love you back, always be the first one to love on someone. A true friend will love his friend no matter what, because that is what love is.
              Happy Valentines Day!</p>
